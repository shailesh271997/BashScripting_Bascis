Bash Scripting Basics
This repository contains basic Bash scripts that demonstrate fundamental scripting concepts. It serves as a beginner-friendly guide to learning and practicing Bash scripting skills.

Loops
Bash supports several types of loops, including for, while, and until loops. These loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The for loop iterates over a sequence of values, while the while loop continues as long as a specified condition is true. The until loop, on the other hand, runs until a specified condition becomes true.

Functions
Functions in Bash allow you to group commands for reuse and better organization.Functions can accept parameters and return values, enabling you to create modular scripts that enhance code readability and maintainability.
